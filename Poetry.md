April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful fire, survivinggut 
A Small life with dried onions.
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
Project team members: Bob, Alice, Asima
My name is Asim Rafiq
I have a team of 5 for IT-CS243 projects
I am talking to the professor

I don't know what I'm doing in the slightest.

I am finishing this assignment late. How lame of me. 
I should not procrasinate on my assignment.
I am doing this assignment last minute. Pray for me
