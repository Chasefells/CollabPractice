Hi
Known 
April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
My name is Asim Rafiq
I have a team of 5 for IT-CS243 projects
I am talking to the professor



I was late to class today!
I don't know what I'm doing in the slightest.

Winter
